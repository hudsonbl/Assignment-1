	<h1><strong>First Post        4/16/17</strong></h1>

	<h3>Challenges to overcome:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Re-learning a language that I haven't coded in for more than a few years</li>
		<li>Figuring out how I want to structure the page, such as lists, do I want to use in line or block elements?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These problems were easily solved by going to the class website. I've found the website to be extremely helpful. It was helpful in data structures.</p>

	<h3>What I learned</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Learning the basic structure of html files</em></li>
		<li><em>Learning different styles through html code, that will later be styled through css</em></li>
		<li>I already had an understanding of how to construct a basic page</li>
		<li>I really enjoy learning the way the browser communicates with the server that the website is hosted on. This was from lecture, and individual research.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>What resources were most helpful?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>As I discussed under challenges to overcome, I found the class website to be the most helpful for this assignment.</li>
		<li>I will be going to office hours this week to discuss the outcomes of this course. Can a student be a self employed website designer? The questions in the sub-list.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>If so, how complex does this course go into website design. Will we learn to make a website with secure transactions?</li>
			<li>If so, where can a student find employment?</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p>I feel that currently the course is moving slow. I understand that HTML may be a new language for some students, but this initial assignment is HTML only. Theres not much content that would be too difficult to understand after a brief reading of some source code or reading the topics on the course website. I'm sure the course will become more difficult as we start to implement css and js. But for now This assignment could have been completed Wednesday of week 2.</p>
