			<p>My previous HTML skills on a scale of 0-10 is a 3. I took cs in highschool and this was 
			the introductory language I took. Although my memory is a little fuzzy, I can successfully 
			make a non CSS or JS integrated website.</p>

		    <p>I hope to learn the languages in this class. I'm restricted to c/c++ and python.
		       I'd like to broaden my horizon. As well as be able to integrate communication between the website and
		       devices in the future. I am interested in hardware such as the Arduino and MachXO3LF.</p>

		    <p>I have signed up for Piazza... I hope it's pepperoni!!</p>

		    <p>Something kind of interesting about me is that on a good day, I can dunk a basketball.
		       On an even better day, I get a few hours of work on a windows app that I am developing.
		       I am making an app to help my grandma keep track of her book payments on her farm. I 
		       am making this app to also practice using data structures. Right now I haven't reached
		       the point of integrating one yet. My current stage is still learning the Win32 enviornment.</p>
